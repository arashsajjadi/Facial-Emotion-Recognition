# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
A deep-learning-based project that detects and classifies human emotions from images and real-time video using PyTorch, ONNX, and GPU-optimized inference. The system can train from scratch, fine-tune existing models, and extract 128-dimensional embeddings for deeper analysis.
